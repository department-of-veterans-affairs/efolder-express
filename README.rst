This is a small application to facilitate downloading the entire eFolder from
VBMS as a single ``.zip`` file.

This application is written in Python, using Twisted, and requires you have
``connect_vbms`` setup on your machine. See the documentation in
``docs/installation.rst`` for complete details on how to get up and running.

eFolder one file at a time:
